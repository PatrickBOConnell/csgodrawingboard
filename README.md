Welcome to CSGO Drawing Board!

The backend for this web application is written using node.js and express.
The webserver is the server.js file found in the home directory. All of the front end is templated in jade.


If you are a contributor, here is what is needed in this project:


-Better icons for the smoke grenade, hand and paintbrush.

-Cleaner frontend in general.

-Any potential bugs.

-BETTER HOSTING.


To make any contributions you can either fork this repo or email me with suggestions at csgodrawingboard@gmail.com


Any help is appreciated!
