  "readme": "# Passport-Steam\n\n[Passport](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport) strategy for authenticating\nwith [Steam](http://www.steam.com/) using OpenID 2.0. This was mostly copied\nand pasted from passport-google, so don't blame me if things break.\n\n\n## Installation\n\n    $ npm install passport-steam\n\n## Usage\n\n#### Configure Strategy\n\nThe Steam authentication strategy authenticates users using a steam account,\nwhich is also an OpenID 2.0 identifier.  The strategy requires a `validate`\ncallback, which accepts this identifier and calls `done` providing a user.\nAdditionally, options can be supplied to specify a return URL and realm.\n\n    passport.use(new SteamStrategy({\n        returnURL: 'http://localhost:3000/auth/steam/return',\n        realm: 'http://localhost:3000/'\n      },\n      function(identifier, done) {\n        User.findByOpenID({ openId: identifier }, function (err, user) {\n          return done(err, user);\n        });\n      }\n    ));\n\n#### Authenticate Requests\n\nUse `passport.authenticate()`, specifying the `'steam'` strategy, to\nauthenticate requests.\n\nFor example, as route middleware in an [Express](http://expressjs.com/)\napplication:\n\n    app.get('/auth/steam',\n      passport.authenticate('steam'),\n      function(req, res){\n        // The request will be redirected to Steam for authentication, so\n        // this function will not be called.\n      });\n\n    app.get('/auth/steam/callback',\n      passport.authenticate('steam', { failureRedirect: '/login' }),\n      function(req, res) {\n        // Successful authentication, redirect home.\n        res.redirect('/');\n      });\n\n## Examples\n\nFor a complete, working example, refer to the [signon example](https://github.com/liamcurry/passport-steam/tree/master/examples/signon).\n\n## Tests\n\n    $ npm install --dev\n    $ make test\n\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/liamcurry/passport-steam.png)](http://travis-ci.org/liamcurry/passport-liamcurry)\n\n## Credits\n\n  - [Jared Hanson](http://github.com/jaredhanson)\n\n## License\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2011 Jared Hanson\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\nthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\nsubject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS\nFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
